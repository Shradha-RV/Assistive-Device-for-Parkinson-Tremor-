A Non-Invasive Handheld Assistive Device to Accommodate Essential Tremor

Development of non-invasive, handheld device using Active Cancellation of Tremor (ACT) technology to stabilize an eating utensil, such as a spoon.

The ACT system senses tremor direction and moves the spoon in the opposite direction to stabilize it. 

The device weighs about 100 grams, with dimensions similar to an electric toothbrush (40 x 50 x 175 mm). Its rechargeable battery lasts for more than 90 minutes of continuous use.

Accelerometer measurements demonstrated 71-76% reduction in tremor with ACT device on.

The device would steady the spoon during holding, eating and transferring tasks.

The ACT Device comprises four key subsystems: the spoon, the motion-generating platform, the controller/sensor, and the power supply.

The spoon attaches to the motion-generating platform and can be removed, cleaned, or replaced. 

The motion-generating platform uses two DC motors connected with mechanical yokes that couple vertical and horizontal motion of the spoon. 

The sensor/controller subsystem uses a tri-axial accelerometer embedded in the spoon base to sense the direction of tremor in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions and directs the motors to move the spoon in the opposite direction.

 Power is supplied by a rechargeable battery in the handle. 
 
The prototype was connected to data acquisition(DAQ) hardware (100 Hz sampling rate, 12 bit accuracy) and a laptop computer running a data acquisition program (written in LabView, version 2010, NIC)
